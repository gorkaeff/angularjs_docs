My AngularJS projects to test with bower.

In the path of this git project, to run the example you need to write in cmd console:

1. To download node_modules:
npm install

2. To download bower_components: 
bower install

3. To run the example (F1 2014), a server starts in port 8000: 
npm start

4. Go to your favourite browser (TODO):
http://localhost:8000/f1
